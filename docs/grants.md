# AlphPad Grants Program / Retired

AlphPad Grants Program is designed to fuel innovation and support promising projects on the Alephium blockchain. This initiative aims to empower developers and entrepreneurs who share our vision of a decentralized future.

## Program Overview

The AlphPad Grants Program is committed to fostering the growth of diverse projects ranging from DeFi and social platforms to infrastructure developments. By providing financial and strategic support, we aim to accelerate the development of projects that bring real value and innovation to the Alephium ecosystem.

## Eligibility and Requirements

To qualify for a grant, projects must:

- Complete a detailed application form.
- Commit to conducting a presale of their project tokens on AlphPad.
- Conduct a whitelist sale and include all addresses which register for the presale and have locked 150k+ APAD.

## Grant Criteria

Our evaluation process considers various factors to ensure that we support projects with the potential for significant impact:

- **Utility:** The project should solve real problems and offer tangible benefits.
- **Tokenomics:** Clear, sustainable, and value-adding token models are favored.
- **Team Reputation:** A proven track record or demonstrable expertise in relevant fields is a bonus.

## Grant Benefits

Approved projects can receive up to $10,000 in funding. While we primarily aim to support projects by purchasing and providing liquidity for their tokens, we remain flexible and open to alternative support mechanisms that better suit the project's needs.

## Application Process

Interested projects can apply for the AlphPad Grants Program by filling out the application form available here: [Grant Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejCyVwjz7PKuNF2sYkb2cMX1tKeO-o9_QE-DOa_pvrmgBmpQ/viewform)

Our team will review each application thoroughly and reach out to promising projects for further discussion.

## Commitment to Growth

Funds for the grants come from our dedicated treasury, consisting of 5 million APAD and 2,500 ALPH. These resources are earmarked to support not just the growth of individual projects but also the broader Alephium ecosystem.
