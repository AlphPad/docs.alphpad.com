# Tokenomics

AlphPad's token economy, designed with sustainability and growth in mind, operates on a zero-inflation model. Here's how we distribute the 100 million $APAD supply, which is the maximum that will ever exist:

## Token Allocation

- **Total Supply:** 100 million ($APAD).

## Distribution Breakdown

- **Token Sale:** 60 million - Unsold tokens are set to be burned, upholding value for existing holders.
- **Team:** 15 million - Locked and staked, linearly vested over 4 years to align with the long-term success of the project.
- **Marketing:** 5 million - These tokens are liquid for immediate use in strategic marketing efforts.

## Liquidity Strategy

- **Allocation for Liquidity:** 20 million $APAD, accounting for 20% of the total supply.
- **Public Sale Funds Pairing:** 1/3 of the funds raised from the public sale will be paired with the 20 million $APAD. This pair is established at a rate of 0.0005 $ALPH per 1 $APAD on the Ayin platform.
- **Burning Mechanism:** If the maximum fundraising target isn't met, the remaining allocated tokens for liquidity will be burned. This ensures the stability and scarcity of $APAD.
