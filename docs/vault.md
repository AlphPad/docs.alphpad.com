### Successful Raise Fee
- **Revenue from Success:** 5% of the total amount raised (in $ALPH value) for every successful fundraising.

### Fees Distribution

### Participation in Alphpad Launches

## Vault Rewards and Mechanics

### Vault Rewards
- **Diversified Earnings:**  Participants who lock $APAD receive rewards in $ALPH, diversifying their benefit stream and deepening their involvement in the Alephium ecosystem.

### Revenue Sharing Model
- **Direct Participation in Success:** Vault participants benefit directly from the platform's operational fees, earning $ALPH tokens as a reward for their engagement.

### Reward Distribution Mechanism
- **Rolling Distribution:** Rewards are spread over a 100-day period, fostering stable and continuous reward flow.
- **Each Reward Split:** Ensuring fairness, each reward is distributed evenly over the next 100 days.
