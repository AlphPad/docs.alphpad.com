# Tier System  

The AlphPad Tier System is designed to offer exclusive access and benefits based on the level of commitment from participants. By locking specific amounts of $APAD tokens, participants can unlock various tiers, each providing a unique bonus percentage that increases with their level of commitment. This structure is built to incentivize deeper engagement with the platform and empower both small and large investors to participate effectively in project launches.

## Tier Overview

## Points and Allocation System  

Each tier corresponds to a set number of points, which determines the participant’s bonus percentage. This point-based system ensures that the more a participant is willing to lock, the higher their bonus and benefits in project launches.  

 **Note:** You only get the points of the tier you achieve, and tiers don’t stack. For example, if you lock 20,000 $APAD in the Vault, you will still get 10 points (Bronze tier) until you reach the next tier, which requires 40,000 $APAD (Silver tier).
