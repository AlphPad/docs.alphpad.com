# Staking

Staking on AlphPad isn't just holding tokens; it's about being an active participant in the ecosystem’s growth and sharing in its success. Here’s how staking benefits both the stakers and the platform:

## Token Utility and Fee Structure

### Listing Fee
- **Prevent Spam:** A fee of $100 in $ALPH for each listing deters spam and ensures only serious projects are submitted.
  
### Successful Raise Fee
- **Revenue from Success:** 5% of the total amount raised (in $ALPH value) for every successful fundraising.

### Fees Distribution
- **Rewarding the Stakers:** 95% of these fees are distributed to the stakers, directly benefiting them for their support and trust in the platform.
- **Tribute to Alephium:** 5% is burned, contributing to the Alephium ecosystem’s health and scarcity.

### Stable Token Supply
- **Fixed Supply:** The $APAD supply is capped at 100 million with a strict no-inflation policy and a burn mechanism, underscoring its commitment to value preservation.

## Staking Rewards and Mechanics

### Staking Rewards
- **Diversified Earnings:** Stakers receive rewards in $ALPH, diversifying their benefit stream and deepening their involvement in the Alephium ecosystem.

### Revenue Sharing Model
- **Direct Participation in Success:** Token holders benefit directly from the platform's operational fees, earning $ALPH tokens as a reward for their staking.

### Reward Distribution Mechanism
- **Rolling Distribution:** Rewards are spread over a 100-day period, fostering stable and continuous reward flow.
- **Each Reward Split:** Ensuring fairness, each reward is distributed evenly over the next 100 days.
- **10-Day Unstaking Period:** Designed to incentivize ongoing staking and prevent exploitation of the rewards system.

Staking on AlphPad is more than just a passive investment; it’s an active engagement in the platform's growth, with direct financial incentives tied to the success of its operations. By staking $APAD, you’re not only supporting the platform but also reaping the rewards of its progress.
