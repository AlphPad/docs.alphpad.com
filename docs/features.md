## Detailed Overview of AlphPad Launchpad Features

- **Initial Offering:**
  - AlphPad supports flat-price sales with flexible customization options. This allows projects to set sales terms that align with their goals and investor expectations.

  - In cases where a sale does not meet its minimum fundraising goal, AlphPad handles refunds seamlessly. This feature ensures a risk-managed approach for both investors and project teams.

- **Whitelisting Capabilities:**
  - AlphPadâ€™s whitelisting feature goes beyond basic participant control, offering advanced options such as setting a maximum bid per whitelisted participant. This ensures a wider and more equitable distribution of tokens, aligning with our goal of fairness in token sales.
  - The versatility of the whitelisting system means it can be utilized for various strategic purposes. Projects can filter out potential gaming attempts, ensuring that only genuine investors participate in the sale.

This is especially valuable for projects needing to adhere to specific legal and regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions.
