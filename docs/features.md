# Features

## Detailed Overview of AlphPad Launchpad Features

- **Initial Offering:**
  - AlphPad supports flat-price sales with flexible customization options. This allows projects to set sales terms that align with their goals and investor expectations.

- **Refundable Sales:**
  - In cases where a sale does not meet its minimum fundraising goal, AlphPad handles refunds seamlessly. This feature ensures a risk-managed approach for both investors and project teams.

- **Vesting Options with or without Cliff:**
  - AlphPad offers projects the ability to set up flexible vesting schedules, allowing tokens to be released over time. Projects can also include a cliff period, where tokens remain locked for a set time before gradual release. This feature ensures better control over token distribution and helps maintain project stability.

- **Vault and Tier System:**
  - AlphPad has introduced a Vault and tier system to replace traditional whitelisting. This system enables participants to lock their $APAD tokens into vaults to gain access to exclusive sales based on their tier.
  - Tier Levels: There are multiple tiers, each with specific benefits and token allocation limits. Higher tiers receive greater token allocations, encouraging long-term commitment from participants.
  - Vault Integration and External Whitelist: Projects are required to include participants from the Vault tiers in their sale, ensuring access for committed users. Additionally, projects have the flexibility to add external whitelisted addresses if needed, allowing for strategic inclusions.

- **Defined Time Limits:**
  - Every token sale on AlphPad is bound by clearly defined start and end dates, fostering transparency and predictability in the sale process.

- **Featured and Standard Launches:**
  - Featured Launches receive full support from AlphPad, including marketing, technical assistance, and strategic partnerships. These projects are carefully vetted, ensuring high-quality listings.
  - Standard Launches are independently managed by projects with minimal support from AlphPad. They offer a straightforward way for projects to launch without extensive vetting, encouraging a wider range of initiatives.

- **Comprehensive Token Overview:**
  - Projects launching on AlphPad are allocated a dedicated space for detailed project documentation and information, ensuring transparency and informed decision-making for potential investors. Mandatory submission of project information ensures accessibility to essential details.

- **Scalability and Diversity:**
  - AlphPad plans to introduce a variety of sale mechanisms, such as Dutch Auctions and other types of auctions, as part of its growth trajectory. This will enhance the platform's scalability and provide diverse fundraising options for projects.

- **$APAD Launch Demonstrator:**
  - AlphPad did a self-launch using its platform, showcasing its capabilities and reliability. This serves as a proof of concept and a demonstration of the platform's efficiency.

- **Regulatory Compliance with Sale Restrictions:**
  - Projects have the ability to set specific country or regional restrictions for their token sales, in accordance with local regulations. This feature is crucial for maintaining compliance and legal integrity for projects and investors alike.
