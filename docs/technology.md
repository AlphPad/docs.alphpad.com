     - SaleFlatPriceAlph: Manages a flat price token sale with optional whitelist.
     - RewardDistributor: Manages a rotating schedule of reward distribution over fixed epochs.
     - Staking: Manages the staking process of tokens, including handling rewards, unstaking, and withdrawing staked assets.
     - ApadToken: The launchpad's native token.

## **Dapp Frontend**
   - Utilizing ReactJS and NextJS, the frontend is developed for optimal performance and scalability.
   - Integrates Alph's prebuilt components to maintain consistency and leverage existing frameworks.

## **Worker**
   - A NodeJS-based cloud worker responsible for handling whitelist registrations and generating proofs essential for the whitelisting systemâ€™s integrity and efficiency.

## **Status Page**

## **Source Code**
   - AlphPad adheres to open-source principles with a nuanced approach. The code will be published on GitHub under the MIT License, but only after a three-month delay post-launch. This strategy balances the need for competitive advantage with our commitment to community contribution and transparency. After this period, developers and users alike will have full access to the codebase, fostering community involvement and collaborative improvement.

## **Audits**

## **Infrastructure**
   - Robust infrastructure with frontends hosted on Cloudflare pages for high availability and performance.
   - Analytics drawn directly from on-chain data, ensuring accurate and real-time insights.
