# Understanding Featured vs. Standard Launches on AlphPad

AlphPad serves as a gateway for innovative projects on the Alephium blockchain, offering two types of launch categories: **Featured Launches** and **Standard Launches**. Each category is designed to cater to different project needs and risk profiles for investors.

AlphPad does not take responsibility for the success or failure of these projects. It is a decentralized launchpad platform, open for everyone, providing accessibility and opportunities for projects of all sizes and stages.

## Featured Launches
Featured Launches are projects that AlphPad actively supports, selected based on quality, innovation, and ecosystem potential. Here’s what they include:
- **Platform Support**: Technical and strategic assistance for smooth and successful launches.
- **Free Marketing**: Promotion via social media, blogs, and community partnerships.
- **Partnerships**: Direct collaboration with AlphPad, strategic guidance, and shared marketing efforts.
- **Close Collaboration**: Assistance from planning to post-launch, maximizing success.

These projects receive AlphPad’s endorsement, reflecting confidence in their vision and fundamentals. While risks remain, due diligence is conducted to ensure quality.

## Standard Launches
Standard Launches operate independently, with no direct support or endorsement from AlphPad:
- **Independent Operation**: Projects manage their own launch, development, and marketing.
- **Higher Risk**: No close collaboration or vetting process, leading to potentially higher risks.
- **Do Your Own Research (DYOR)**: Investors are strongly encouraged to research before participating.
- **Disclaimers**: Investing is at the investor’s discretion, and AlphPad does not endorse or verify claims.

### Important Disclaimer
Participation in Standard Launches involves risks, including potential loss of investment. Investors are urged to exercise caution and do thorough research.

## TLDR
AlphPad offers both Featured and Standard Launches to cater to diverse project and investor profiles. Whether seeking strong platform backing or exploring new ventures independently, it’s crucial to understand the differences and assess risk tolerance when participating.
