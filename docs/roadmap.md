### Performance Optimisation
- Implement caching solutions to enhance frontend performance.

### Sale Contracts V2
Rollout of Sale Contracts V2 to enhance platform functionality and flexibility, addressing community feedback and introducing new features:
- **Enhanced Control for Sellers**: Sellers must claim their funds first before buyers can claim tokens, adding security to the process.
- **Fairer Public Sales**: Introduction of a ‘Max bid per address’ feature to ensure a more equitable distribution of tokens.
- **Versatile Vesting Options**:
  - **Linear Vesting Until Date**: Tokens vested linearly until a specified date.
  - **Cliff for Linear Vesting**: Initial cliff period, followed by linear vesting.
  - **Upfront Release Portion**: Option to release a portion of tokens upfront before the vesting period starts.

## Q3 2024 - Optimizations and Upgrades
### AlphPad Tier System Launch
- Official launch of the tier system after extensive development and testing, marking a new chapter for AlphPad. This system enables structured and fair engagement in token sales across five tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, each with varying buy limits and incentives.

### Changes in the Listing Process
- **Integrated Listing Wizard**: Replacing the outdated GitHub-based system, the new wizard allows seamless on-chain listing and sale creation, making the process more intuitive.
- **Cost Structure Adjustments**: 
  - Listing fee set at 10 ALPH, removing the $ to ALPH conversion.
  - Total cost of 12 ALPH for listing and sale, with 10 ALPH going to the rewards pool and 2 ALPH for contract deployments.

### Listing Separation on Landing Page
Sales are now categorized into:
- **Coming Soon**: Projects in the pipeline, providing early visibility.
- **Live Sales**: Ongoing sales that users can participate in.
- **Past Sales**: Completed sales, offering insights into previous launches.

### Featured vs. Regular Launches
Introduction of a clearer distinction:
- **Featured Launches**: Receive extensive marketing support, including promotional campaigns and higher visibility.
- **Regular Launches**: Open for all projects with minimal support, simplifying the process for a broader range of projects.

## 2025 - Expansion Phase

### DEX Aggregator
Developing a decentralized exchange aggregator to streamline trading across multiple DEX platforms, offering users the best rates and a seamless trading experience.

### CEX Listings
Working towards listing on major centralized exchanges (CEX) to increase liquidity, accessibility, and exposure for the $APAD token.

### Auctions
Introducing new auction mechanisms for token sales, providing projects with more flexible options to raise funds and engage the community.

### Website Improvements
Enhancing the user experience by updating the website design, improving navigation, and adding new features to make project discovery easier.

### Documentation Overhaul
Revamping all documentation to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness. This will include updated guides, FAQs, and resources to help users navigate the platform more effectively.
